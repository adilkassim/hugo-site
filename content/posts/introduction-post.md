Welcome!
===============

I've been wanting to start a blog for a while, and I'm excited to actually create it now. 

Not really sure what exactly I'll be writing about, but I guess I'll figure it out as I go.

The inspiration behind creating this blog is to write about soccer, specifically the Premier League and Arsenal. I love all things soccer, and I think it would be fun to share my thoughts and opinions on the league, as well as work on my data skills. An inspiration for this blog is *[Owen Phillips](https://x.com/owenlhjphillips)* and his blog [*The F5*](https://thef5.substack.com/) on Substack. I really enjoy reading his work with data and the NBA, and I aspire to write in a similar vein about soccer. 
There are other soccer writers on Substack that have inspired me such as *[The Python Football Review](https://www.pythonfootball.com/?utm_campaign=profile_chips)*, *[Experimental 361](https://www.experimental361.com/)*, and more. 

This blog, however, isn't all about soccer. I hope to write about other topics as well, such as data science, programming, and other interests of mine. I really want to create things, and use this blog as a way to document my journey in learning new skills and creating new things. 

I hope I can use this to hold myself accountable in learning new things and creating new things.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy the blog!
